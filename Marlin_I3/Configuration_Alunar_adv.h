 * Thermal Protection protects your printer from damage and fire if a
 * thermistor falls out or temperature sensors fail in any way.
 *
 * The issue: If a thermistor falls out or a temperature sensor fails,
 * Marlin can no longer sense the actual temperature. Since a disconnected
 * thermistor reads as a low temperature, the firmware will keep the heater on.
 *
 * The solution: Once the temperature reaches the target, start observing.
 * If the temperature stays too far below the target (hysteresis) for too long (period),
 * the firmware will halt the machine as a safety precaution.
 *
 * If you get false positives for "Thermal Runaway" increase THERMAL_PROTECTION_HYSTERESIS and/or THERMAL_PROTECTION_PERIOD

   * degrees, the machine is halted, requiring a hard reset. This test restarts with any M104/M109,
   * but only if the current temperature is far enough below the target for a reliable test.
   *
   * If you get false positives for "Heating failed" increase WATCH_TEMP_PERIOD and/or decrease WATCH_TEMP_INCREASE
   * WATCH_TEMP_INCREASE should not be below 2.
